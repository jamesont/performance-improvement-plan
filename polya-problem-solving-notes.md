#Polya's Method

Things I need to do before even beginning a problem:

# First Principal: understand the problem
1) Make sure I understand all of the words in a problem
2) Make sure I understand what is sought from the problem
3) I need to make sure I can restate the problem in my own words
4) Can I draw a picture or diagram that would help me solve this?
5) Is there enough information to help me make a solution?
  - if not, where can I find more information?

#Devise a plan:

There are a ton of ways to solve a problem:

- guess and check
- make a list
- eliminate possibilities
- use symmetry
- consider special cases
- use direct reasoning
- solve an equation
- look for a pattern
- draw a picture
- solve a simpler problem
- use a model
- work backwards
- use a formula
- be ingenious

#Carry out the plan

- This is easier than devising a plan (usually)
- In general all you need is care and patience.
  -  This is currently my biggest draw back: having patience to understand the problem.
- Next, I need to continue with the plan. If it doesn't work I need to discard it and choose another plan.

#Look back

- Reflect on what I have done. Understand what worked and what didn't. This will help me predict future problems.

#To Reiterate:

1. Understand the problem.
- What is unknown about this problem? What is the data? What is the condition?
- Can we satisfy the condition? Is it sufficient to determine the unknown? Or is it insufficient? Or redundant? Contradictory?
- Can I draw a figure? Use suitable notation?
- Separate and write the various parts of the condition. Can I write them all down?

2. Devise a plan
- Find a connection between the data and the unknown. I first may have to answer other questions about the problem first to get to the final problem. I should eventually have a plan of the solution.
- Have I seen this problem before? Maybe I've seen it in a different form?
- Have I ever seen a related problem? Do I know any useful theorems?
-  I should look at the unknown and try to have a familiar problem having the same or similar unknown.
- Could I use a related problem's method or result?
- Can I restate the problem multiple ways?
- If I can't solve the problem, try a similar problem. Can I solve part of the problem, one part of the condition? Can I determine anything useful from the data? Can I change the unknown or the data so that the new unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?
- Did I use all the data and the condition? Have I taken into account all essential notions in the problem?

3. Carry out the plan
- Check each step. Is the step correct? Can I prove this?

4. Look back
- Examine the solution.
- Can I check the result?
- Can I check the argument?
- Can I get the solution in another way?
- Can I see it at a glance?
- Can I use the result or methods for other problems?
